# Study tube code challenge

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.

## Requirements:
- Node
* Install the latest LTS version of Node.js from https://nodejs.org. IMPORTANT: The server uses ES2015 features AND the Angular CLI so you need a current version of Node.js.

## Run the Application

Simply clone the project or download and extract the .zip to get started.

1. Run `npm install` to install app dependencies

2. Run `npm start` in a separate terminal window to launch the web and RESTful API server

3. Go to http://localhost:4200 in your browser 

* For developmet mode:
    Run `ng build --watch` to build and bundle the code

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
